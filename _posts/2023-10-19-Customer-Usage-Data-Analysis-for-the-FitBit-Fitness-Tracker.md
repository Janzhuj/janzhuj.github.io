## Introduction

This is customer usage data analysis projcet for a fitness tracker procucted by Bellabeat company. The devices monitors health vitals of the customer. Bellabeat is looking to expand their business and would like to perform a marketing analytics. To do this we need to get insight from the device usage sampled from 33 customers.


In this post, I will use clustering algorithm to perform Customer Segmentation for an e-commerce store. It will helps the business to better understand its customers, and modify its products and Marketing strategy based on the specific segments. I will be using a widely known data set from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).  

First letâ€™s load the required packages.

{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)  
library(readxl) 
library(kableExtra)
library(flextable)
library(DataExplorer) 
library(dlookr) 
library(highcharter) 
library(tm) 
library(wordcloud)
library(corrplot) 
library(viridis) 
library(xts)
library(rfm) 
library(clustertend) 
library(factoextra)
library(NbClust)  
library(clValid)
library(fpc) 
{% endhighlight %}

Load the dataset and take a quick look.

{% highlight r %}
df<-read_excel("Online_Retail.xlsx")
head(df,5)
str(df)
summary(df) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
n_distinct(df$CustomerID) 
n_distinct(df$Description)
n_distinct(df$Country)
{% endhighlight %}

The dataset consists of 541,909 rows and 8 features. Most of features have correct formats, but some features need to be converted for better analysis in the next step, like InvoiceNo and the InvoiceDate. The dataset involves 25900 transactions, 4373 customers, 4212 products and 38 country

## Data Preparation

### Data Cleaning

Let's check and deal with missing values.

{% highlight r %}
cat("Number of missing value:", sum(is.na(df)), "\n")
plot_na_pareto(df)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
Number of missing value: 136534 
{% endhighlight %}
